# Flood-segmentation-model
This project implements a deep learning model for segmenting water in remote sensing or satellite images. The model leverages a U-Net architecture built using TensorFlow and Keras, designed for efficient pixel-wise segmentation of water bodies from multi-channel TIFF images.
